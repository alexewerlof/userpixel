# Hi! :wave:

I enjoy learning new technologies and creating solutions to interesting problems.
Most of my daily commits are in Github Enterprise, but there are a couple of projects here that I work on from time to time:

- [Micromustache](https://github.com/userpixel/micromustache) a super quick template engine with focus on security and simplicity
- [jTy](https://github.com/userpixel/jty) the bare minimum API to write safer JavaScript applications that fail early instead of going about the wrong type assumptions
- [am](https://github.com/userpixel/am) a simple and light way to run a main function asynchronously
